#Simulink_simulations

Simulation of 3 systems in Simulink

Simulink model and the MATLAB script to run the simulation provided

Systems:

Car suspension system: Simulation of the behaviour of a car suspension system when the car is driven over an obstacle with varying speed and loading of the car

Positioning system: Study the effect of a control system employed for positioning in a machine tool and improving the behaviour of the system by parameter tuning

Hydraulic tanks system: Simulation of two coupled hydraulic tanks system and investigation of the characteristics of the resulting system when the tanks are connected in different ways
